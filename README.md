# Generals of Chaos Development System Requirements, Design Tips, Tricks, and Configurations for Applications

Welcome to the **Generals of Chaos Development Repository**—your comprehensive resource hub for managing, configuring, and optimizing applications and tools within our projects. This repository serves as a collaborative space where developers, testers, and contributors can share best practices, configurations, and resources for effective application deployment and management.

---

## **Purpose**
This repository consolidates everything you need to streamline the setup, configuration, and optimization of applications used across various Generals Triaging Chaos projects. Whether you're installing software, tweaking configurations, or integrating hardware and performance monitoring (APM), this is your one-stop resource.

---

## **Repository Structure**

- **/installables/**
  - Contains links or direct access to executable files (`.exe`) and installation packages for supported applications.

- **/configurations/**
  - Predefined configuration files and templates for commonly used setups.

- **/license_keys/**
  - Secure storage for application license keys or instructions on how to access them (restricted access).

- **/tips_tricks/**
  - Best practices, shortcuts, and advice for optimizing application performance and usage.

- **/collaboration/**
  - Documentation and logs of collaboration efforts on testing, hardware tweaking, and application customizations.

- **/resources/**
  - Links to additional documentation, tutorials, and external resources for learning.

- **/APM/**
  - Application Performance Monitoring configurations, scripts, and testing guidelines.
